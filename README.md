Roboto AI is a versatile Discord bot powered by AI that provides a natural conversational experience. It's designed to understand your server context, respond to messages, play music, generate images, and more.

## üåü Key Features

- **Natural Conversation**: Simply mention Roboto by name to start a conversation
- **Music Playback**: Search and play music from YouTube or local MP3s
- **Image Generation**: Create and edit images with natural language instructions
- **Voice Responses**: Ask Roboto to speak using advanced text-to-speech technology
- **Multilingual Support**: Communicate in English, Spanish, or French
- **Server Configuration**: Customize Roboto's behavior for your specific Discord server

## üîç How It Works

Unlike traditional command-based bots, Roboto is designed to provide a more natural interaction experience:

- **Just Mention Him**: Call Roboto by his name anywhere in your message and he'll respond
- **Reply to Messages**: Reply to his messages for continued conversation
- **Context-Aware**: He remembers your conversations and maintains context
- **Intelligent Responses**: He'll choose the most appropriate function based on your request

While Roboto supports traditional slash commands, his true power lies in natural conversation. Simply say:

```
Hey Roboto, can you play some relaxing music?
```

And he'll understand what you need without requiring specific command syntax!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- A Discord account and server with admin privileges
- OpenAI API key


### Discord Bot Setup

Before installing and running the bot, you need to create a Discord application and bot user:

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on "New Application" and give your application a name.
3. Go to the "Bot" tab in the left sidebar and click "Add Bot".
4. Customize your bot's name and avatar as desired.
5. Under the "Token" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot token. You'll need this for the config.json file.
6. In the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section, enable "Message Content Intent".
7. Go to the "OAuth2" tab in the left sidebar, then select "URL Generator".
8. In the "Scopes" section, select "bot".
9. In the "Bot Permissions" section, select the permissions your bot needs (at minimum: "Read Messages/View Channels", "Send Messages", and "Read Message History").
10. Copy the generated URL at the bottom of the page.
11. Open this URL in a new tab and select the server you want to add the bot to. You must have the "Manage Server" permission to add bots to a server.

Now your Discord bot is set up and added to your server(s).

Roboto AI can also play MP3 audio files stored locally on the server. To use this feature, simply place your MP3 files in the `assets/mp3` directory.

When requesting playback, just mention the name of the audio file or be specific by indicating that the track is stored locally. Roboto will automatically search the `assets/mp3` folder and play the matching file if found.

This feature enables you to easily integrate custom audio clips, jingles, or music without relying solely on external streaming services.

```
/language locale:[en|es|fr]
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Generation

```

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Capability

Roboto doesn‚Äôt just respond with text‚Äîhe can also **speak** to you. When you ask a question or make a request, you can tell him to use his **voice** to reply. This is made possible through advanced text-to-speech (TTS) integration, and you can simply ask him to respond using his voice.

Roboto AI is a versatile Discord bot powered by AI that provides a natural conversational experience. It's designed to understand your server context, respond to messages, play music, generate images, and more.

## üåü Key Features

- **Natural Conversation**: Simply mention Roboto by name to start a conversation
- **Music Playback**: Search and play music from YouTube or local MP3s
- **Image Generation**: Create and edit images with natural language instructions
- **Voice Responses**: Ask Roboto to speak using advanced text-to-speech technology
- **Multilingual Support**: Communicate in English, Spanish, or French
- **Server Configuration**: Customize Roboto's behavior for your specific Discord server

## üîç How It Works

Unlike traditional command-based bots, Roboto is designed to provide a more natural interaction experience:

- **Just Mention Him**: Call Roboto by his name anywhere in your message and he'll respond
- **Reply to Messages**: Reply to his messages for continued conversation
- **Context-Aware**: He remembers your conversations and maintains context
- **Intelligent Responses**: He'll choose the most appropriate function based on your request

While Roboto supports traditional slash commands, his true power lies in natural conversation. Simply say:

```
Hey Roboto, can you play some relaxing music?
```

And he'll understand what you need without requiring specific command syntax!
